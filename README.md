# MatchInterval
# Evaluate Correspondence of Extreme Climate and Cultural Change
Matchinterval.dpr is the Delphi Source code for the program.  That source code relies on a library of routines provided in KWKSTDXE.pas that can be separately compiled.
Matchinterval.exe is a Windows executable that should run on Windows XP, 7, 8, and 8.1. (Tested in Windows 7.)
MatchClimate.csv and MatchTrans.csv are test data sets with the climatic extreme dates and the transformation dates, respectively.
